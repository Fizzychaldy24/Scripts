1. Basic Bash Script (for Linux/Mac)

What is Bash?

    *Bash is a shell scripting language used for automating tasks in a Linux or Mac terminal.
    You can create Bash scripts to perform system tasks like file management, installations, or even automation of daily operations.

What this script does:

    It prints some welcome messages.
    Creates a directory called MyNewDirectory.
    Changes to that directory.
    Creates a simple text file (testfile.txt).
    Lists the files in that directory.

Creating Your First Bash Script:
    1. Open a Terminal (or command line interface on your system): Ctrl+Alt+T sometimes just ctrl + T
    2. Create a new file for your script: {touch my_script.sh}
    3.Make the script executable: {chmod +x my_script.sh}

Edit the script (use any text editor, e.g., nano, vim, or code): {nano my_script.sh}
or use any text editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.

Script content:
{
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, welcome to my first script!"
echo "This is a basic Bash script."

# Create a directory
mkdir MyNewDirectory
echo "A new directory called 'MyNewDirectory' has been created."

# Change into that directory
cd MyNewDirectory
echo "You are now in the 'MyNewDirectory' directory."

# Create a simple text file
echo "This is a test file" > testfile.txt
echo "A text file 'testfile.txt' has been created."

# List the contents of the directory
ls
}

Save and exit the editor (for nano: press CTRL + X, then Y to confirm, then Enter).

Run the script:

    ./my_script.sh
